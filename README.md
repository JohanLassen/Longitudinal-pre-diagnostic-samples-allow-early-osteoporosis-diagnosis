# Longitudinal pre-diagnostic samples allow early osteoporosis diagnosis


## Introduction

There are four scripts in total. 
1. `ml_preprocessing.R` is used to perform statistical preprocessing of the feature table.
2. `preprocessing_utils.R` contains utility functions for the ml_preprocessing script.
3. `utils.R` contains additional utility functions used both by ml_preprocessing and the statistical_analysis markdown file.
4. `statistical_analysis.rmd` Performs the calculations and visualizations presented in the paper.

Prior to the statistical preprocessing (step 1 script) the data was preprocessed in XCMS using this [workflow](https://johanlassen.github.io/cXCMS/articles/HPC_workflow.html)

Also some additional analyses requested by the reviewers are in the statistical analysis script but are not included in the study.
